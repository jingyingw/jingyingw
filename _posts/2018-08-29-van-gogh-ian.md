_Litter by sidewalks, red sticks high up, half burnt, soured rice drained in rainwater soup - all green, not moldy, not sandy, not exactly alive. Gods will find it ugly. Little plastic wrapping paper around open cakes, pastries goodly displayed not eaten by stray dogs - yet. Towards the road, all the dead, all the not dead yet._

1 { Ren comes to sip diluted Milo by the dirty table, sniffing the offerings to the road like a narc dog, disapproving of the local religious rites. Mar notices and hates such bourgeoisie, new-age scientific disrespect of culture, he sees it in Ren’s eyes. Mar dilutes Ren’s Milo more and more each time, till Ren did not come no more. }
