_Litter by sidewalks, red sticks high up, half burnt, soured rice drained in rainwater soup - all green, not moldy, not sandy, not exactly alive. Gods will find it ugly. Little plastic wrapping paper around open cakes, pastries goodly displayed not eaten by stray dogs - yet. Towards the road, all the dead, all the not dead yet._

1 { Ren comes to sip diluted Milo by the dirty table, sniffing the offerings to the road like a narc dog, disapproving of the local religious rites. Mar notices and hates such bourgeoisie, new-age scientific disrespect of culture, he sees it in Ren’s eyes. Mar dilutes Ren’s Milo more and more each time, till Ren did not come no more. }

2 { Mar actually went to school. Mar was good at English, (he wished it was some other more beautiful, less sinister language.) Mar was top of the class at English. Mar did not go to university because he sees no point in his family’s indifference and comforting poverty, where barely scraping by was a method of life that nobody was too energetic to change. Mar taught in night seminars, but was mocked for his accent. Mar ended up selling Milo because he thought there was a nice ring to his name. It is probably the only bit of romanticism Mar could afford, or the only bit that his self-effacing limitedness will allow him to have. }

3 { It doesn’t matter how well you know the language. You sound so fucking weird, you sound like someone stuck dog food into your mouth. }
