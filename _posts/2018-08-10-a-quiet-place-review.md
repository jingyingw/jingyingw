There can be nothing worse than stepping on a huge nail and then having to have a baby alone in your underground bathtub, the whole while having to hold back your pain, your screeching inside that you were taught to express, to use, to instinctively cry like a baby - because you cannot make a sound. Or they’ll hunt you down in seconds, using their fast-all-knowing superears, and you’ll be torn into blood. While this is definitely the stickiest situation on screen in a while, it did cast a sombre shadow on my heart when it dawned on me that the scene is very real. It happens all the time - around us are people who cannot make sounds, people who simply cannot say the wrong things under the sky-web of universal superears, and they have to endure to survive.

In a sense, A Quiet Place is the perfect metaphor of the animalistic, primally brutal pillars of modern society. It is sly in that it pretends to be a movie about the fundamentals of humanity - family, love, and survival - and it is true that these themes are usually the case when a small number of characters are being experimented with in a setting that they really cannot escape from. However, more so, it projects and magnifies the side of our lives that we normally gawk at and think about for few seconds at a time and feel surprised about - how much do other people really know about us? How are our emotions being suppressed here? How have our chosen mediums of expression been limited by what is accepted around or what is taboo, forbidden by what everyone else thinks everyone else thinks? - but would normally have us comfortably numb about them soon again into a tightly knitted alternate reality. It reverses Get Out’s argument or rather, looks at the issue on an alternate angle - is it that our screams are not heard, or are we not allowed to scream in the first place? 
**Creatures**
Thought Police. Surveillance. Cameras. For some reason, the Aliens-resembling  creatures immediately reminded me of the monochromatic and typically brutal loyalist police forces in dystopian novels. Their megaears hear everything, and they move so fast that once you are not careful about your sound, you are dead in a matter of seconds - is that how fast search filters work? It is certainly faster than the deletion of posts by internet moderators, by google search filters, or something worse. What else is there that corresponds to it in our lives?

They are blind, but they hear so well. They do not see thoughts (represented by light) but they do capture expression (sound). What a clever use of human senses.
**Gender Roles**
It is to be noticed that the movie centers around this super-traditional, 1960s-post-WWII nuclear family. Of course there is the technical girl who does want adventures and that slightly reserved fearful little brother. And the center of the family is of course the masculine father, supported by the feminine counterparts of the pregnant, laundry-and-cooking-occupied mother. However, whether intentional or not, the movie does take a feminist and liberal stance on the traditional family, albeit with a strange tone. We see that the second greatest threat to this family, next to the creatures, is that they are not using their own abilities to the maximum. Why couldn’t the girl go do what she is good at? And what else is there in the world that requires greater strength than the pregnancy scene? 

The most endearing thing that the movie does is that it does not villainize the father for his opinions and actions. Instead, it takes a side route to what it think is right. In the end scene, where the little brother is rightfully holding the child, the mother cocks the shotgun while the girl shots up the volume of her high frequency generator. It is the ones that need protection the most that found out the solution to the entire world’s woe, and the comforter has found his place as well. Does the father need to die for this to happen?
**Death and Birth**
In the most desolate moments of the movie, the baby is born. As soon as it is it is enclosed into a coffin-like cradle, being shut off and muffled with a wooden board on top. Life without expression is still life that continues, but it is equivalent to death.
**Sound**
What is sound supposed to be, exactly?

An important distinction is made between light and sound in the movie, metaphor for thought and expression respectively. We raise light that others cannot see, we commit suicide by producing sound… what is it trying to say? This mirrors nicely with Get Out’s Sunken Place where your scream is not heard. Better not produce that scream in the first place.

That is why when most characters come to make a sound, being able to verbalize, they don’t speak anything. They don’t shout, they scream. There’s just too much inside.

But then again, they could just live next to the waterfall.
**The Solution**
Previously, when the family is lead by the father, the solution is simply: shh. Raise the finger stoically to the lips, you do not produce anything so the creatures won’t notice you.

But come the father’s death, come his legacy - the hearing aids that the daughter wears - it is discovered that a frequency high enough and loud enough will kill or confuse the creature. To the point that you could just shoot them. What an excellent metaphor.

That’s the movie’s suggestion to us: if you make a sound that has a frequency high enough and that is loud enough, you can wade away all horrors coming your way. 

But, please, make sure you are not alone.
