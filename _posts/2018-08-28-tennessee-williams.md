I notice that one of many interesting themes in William’s life is the polarity, or perhaps causational relationship, between his deformed and typically ill-fated family and his work. His (somewhat degenerate) father had in mind for him a traditional, singular way to succeed in the conservative Southern US, and his home life with his mother is characterized by repression and conflicts that crumble inwards for the family. It is unsurprising that being unlike yet fundamentally from his family, Williams would choose expression as his means of survival.

The intensity of his writing process is perhaps a result of these disparities between his reality and his mental, creative outlet. Rather from his later experiences or later success, the most applauded content in Williams’ work came from his home life. Could it be that he spent his entire life in attempt to resolve his childhood? Through his most celebrated pieces, Williams tears bare the painfully real, less attractive aspects of life underneath the well-packaged society, and perhaps his Southern cultural background gave him an even more gifted way of expression (at least in Cat, so far) - his characters are rooted in a superficially socially acceptable reality, but their expressions are not. By touching taboo subjects that are inexplicably so relevant to most peoples’ lives, perhaps he truly understood people for himself, regardless of gender and background (this I would attribute to his upbringing with his mother and sister) that allowed him to express a fluid amorphousness of femininity and masculinity in his work. 

Williams never gave up writing - arguably, his own ‘tenacity’ (Maggie) - but chose to sunk his tragic later life, like his father, into debauchery. Despite being ‘always in the game’ it is especially tragic to see his strength, or stubbornness to be proudly inherited by his characters, and Williams does have a special capacity of projecting his own identity into both Maggie and Brick in his work. The tragedies that befall Williams in his lifetime - his close family departing him (Merlo, Rose by illness), and his constantly sensitive relationship with the critics and audience of his works, serves to allow him to ultimately articulate the coexistence of ‘tenderness’ and ‘extremities’ of a human lifetime. Williams casts the mental shadows from his childhood and youth into the piteous glamor of his characters, an act to be applauded in its own right.
